## About The Project

<br>

The New York Clone, as the name suggests, is a clone website of the popular newspaper “The New York Times”. The website has been created as part of the React course within the Master in Blockchain Development provided by start2impact university.

<br>

The main purpose of this website is to demonstrate the skills I have acquired during this course. I learned how to properly integrate external APIs in a React project. In order to add more pages to my SPA (Single Page Application), I also decided to implement the authentication feature with a reserved area for the user, as well as providing the opportunity to save articles and books the user liked, for future reference and consultation.

<br>

The authentication feature has been implemented via firebase, the renowned BaaS (Back-end as a Service) freely provided by Google. The global state is maintained by Zustand, so that the user interface remain coherent for logged-in users, and differs from the public version of the website for non-authenticated users.

<br>

Feel free to explore the website, to acquire prime quality knowledge provided by the NYT and to contact me through my social media channels at the bottom of the page.
